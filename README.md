##Vinyls Database

I am creating an app to search the mySQL database of
my owned vinyls. You can search 4 ways:

1. Random vinyl
2. Search by album number (1-n)
3. Search by album name (best guess)
4. Search by artist name (presents options of all 
available albums)

TODO: 

- UPC label lookup
- Spotify / TIDAL lookup via API

Thanks!
